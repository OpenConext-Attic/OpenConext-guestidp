# SURFnet SURFconext Guest IdP 1.11.0 Release Notes #

As of version v1.14.0 we don't want twitter anymore in the guestIdp WAYF. We have therefore updated 'config/authsources.php'. Because of the fact that facebook is configured with a key that is not in SVN the SVN file:

/opt/www/guestidp/config/authsources.php

Is configured to use a localConfig:

[root@t01 surfconext]# tail /opt/www/guestidp/config/authsources.php 

	),
	*/

);

$localConfig = '/etc/surfconext/guestidp.authsources.config.php';
if (file_exists($localConfig)) {
    require $localConfig;
}

Therefore the file:

/etc/surfconext/guestidp.authsources.config.php 

Needs to be updates as well:

$config['multi'] = array(
    'multiauth:MultiAuth',

    /*
     * The available authentication sources.
     * They must be defined in this authsources.php file.
    */
    'sources' => array('facebook', 'google', 'yahoo', 'hyves'),

The sources array must NOT contain twitter.
