Installing and configuring the consent module
=============================================

The consent module is implemented as an Authentication Processing Filter. That means it can be configured in the global config.php file or the SP remote or IdP hosted metadata.

It is recommended to run the consent module at the IdP, and configure the filter to run after all attribute mangling filters is completed, to show the user the exact same attributes that are sent to the SP.

Configure the user ID
---------------------

In order to generate the privacy preserving hashes in the consent module, you need to name one attribute that always is available and that is unique to all users. An example of such an attribute is eduPersonPrincipalName.

In your `saml20-idp-hosted.php` add the name of the user ID attribute:

	'userid.attribute' => 'uid', 

If the attribute defined above is not available for a user, an error message will be shown, and the user will not be allowed through the filter. So make sure that you select an attribute that is available to all users.


The first step: consent module with cookie as storage
-----------------------------------------------------

We reccomend to try to enable the consent module with cookie as a storage, before setting up a database.

To enable the consent module, touch an `enable` file, in the consent module:

	touch modules/consent/enable

Then edit `config.php` and look for the `authproc.idp` configuration. Uncomment the followig filter configuration:

	90 => array(
		'class' 	=> 'consent:Consent', 
		'store' 	=> 'consent:Cookie', 
		'focus' 	=> 'yes', 
		'checked' 	=> TRUE
	),

Then login through an SP and make sure that you are asked for consent.


Setting up a database
---------------------

Here is the initialization SQL script for PostgreSQL:

	CREATE TABLE consent (
		consent_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
		usage_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
		hashed_user_id VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,
		service_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
		attribute VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,
		UNIQUE (hashed_user_id, service_id)
	);


Configuring the processing filter
---------------------------------

### Options ###
The following options can be used when configuring the Consent module

`Ã¬ncludeValues`
:   Boolean value that indicate whether the values of the attributes should be 
used in calculating the unique hashes that identifies the consent. If 
includeValues is set and the value of an attribute changes, then the consent
becomes invalid. This option is optional and defaults to FALSE. 

`checked`
:   Boolean value that indicate whether the "Remember" consent checkbox is
checkd by default. This option is optional and defaults to FALSE. 

`focus`
:   Indicates whether the "Yes" or "No" button is in fucus by default. This
option is optional and can take the value 'yes' or 'no' as strings. If omitted
neither will recive focus.

`store`
:   Configuration of the Consent store. See seperate section on setting up
consent using different storage methods.

`hiddenAttributes`
:   Whether the value of the attributes should be hidden. Set to an array of
the attributes that should have it value hidden. Default behaviour is that all
attribute values are shown

### Options set elswhere ###
The following options can be set in otherplaces

`privacypolicy`
:   This is an absolute URL for where an user can find a privacy policy for SP. 
If set, this will be shown on the consent page. %SPENTITYID% in the URL
will be replaced with the entityID of the service provider.

:   This option can be set in [SP-remote metadata](./simplesamlphp-reference-sp-remote) 
and in [IdP-hosted metadata](./simplesamlphp-reference-idp-hosted). 
The entry in the SP-remote metadata overrides the option in the IdP-hosted 
metadata.

`consent.disable`
:   Disable consent for a set of services. See section `Disabling consent`

`userid.attribute`
:   Unique identifier that is released for all users. See section `Configure
the user ID`.

Example config using PostgreSQL database:

	90 => array(
		'class' 	=> 'consent:Consent', 
		'store' 	=> array(
			'consent:Database', 
			'dsn' => 'pgsql:host=sql.uninett.no;dbname=andreas_consent',
			'username' => 'simplesaml',
			'password' => 'sdfsdf',
		),
		'focus' 	=> 'yes', 
		'checked' 	=> TRUE
	),

Disabling consent
-----------------

It is possible to disable consent for a given service. You can add an option
in the matadata on the IdP, that will disable consent for det given service.
Add 'consent.disable' array option and enter the entityids of the services,
that you do not want consent for.

Example:

    'consent.disable' => array(
        'sp.example.com',
        'sp2.example.com',
        ...
    ),
